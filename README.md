# TrayHWMonitor

I am very used to having CPU/Memory graph in my taskbar, however windows 11 doesn't support widgets in the taskbar anymore.
Because of that I decided to go around that and use the app icons to create my own.

Every icon shows up to 8 cpu cores (because the icon size is limited to 16x16)
//I have 24 cores
The last icon is a RAM indicator which turns orange at usage >= 80% red-orange at usage >= 90% and red at usage >= 95%
